Wave Function Collapse initializes output bitmapin a completely unobserved state, where each pixel value is in a superposition of colors of the input bitmap (so if the input was black-white then the unobserved states are shown in different shades of grey). The coefficients in these superpositions are real numbers, not complex numbers, so it doesnâ€™t do the actual quantum mechanics, but it was inspired by QM. In this, we have been matching each tile to tile value by pixel to pixel by namingas it as "socket". We know that in code when we match the tile it would be in a random order so we had rotated them into a specific order to match each socket to socket which indicates the overlapping of tiles as the superposition of several Eigen states. It was first introduced in 2016 by Maxim Gumin which can generate procedural patterns from a sample image or from a collection of tiles. So we are just visualizing it in a mathematical way.
